#Design & Implementation of Bandgap Reference Voltage Circuit Using Cadence EDA Tools
Design & Implementation of Bandgap Reference Voltage Circuit Using Cadence EDA Tools
Aim: To design and implement a Bandgap Reference Voltage Circuit using Cadence EDA tools and to verify its behavior across temperature and voltage variations.
Tools Required:
Personal Computer
Cadence Virtuoso Software
1. Initial Setup:
Now, two windows should open:
1.Virtuoso/Command Interpreter Window (CIW)
2.“What’s New…” window (close this window).
Use the Virtuoso CIW window for all further processing.
2. Create a New Library:
Go to File → New → Library.
Name your library (e.g., Bandgap_Reference_Voltage).
Enable Attach to an existing technology library, and click OK.
Attach the library to the technology library (e.g., gpdk045) and click OK.
3. Create Schematic Cell View:
In the Virtuoso CIW window, go to File → New → Cellview.
Set up the new file form:
oLibrary: Select the one you created (e.g., Bandgap_Reference_Voltage).
oCell: Name the cell (e.g., Bandgap_Reference).
oView: Select Schematic.
oPress OK.
Add the required components (transistors, resistors, current mirrors) from the libraries.
To add components:
oGo to Instance Fixed menu or press I on the keyboard to bring up the instance browser.
oSelect the appropriate library (e.g., gpdk045 for MOSFETs or other components like resistors).
Make the necessary connections using the Fixed Narrow Wire tool.
Create Input and Output pins (e.g., Vin, Vref for the reference voltage).
After connecting all components, click Check and Save.
4. Creating the Symbol for the Schematic Cell View:
In the schematic window, execute Create → Cell view → From Cell view.
The From Cellview window appears. Ensure the Lib Name, Cell Name, and From View are correct.
Press OK.
The Symbol Generation Form appears. Click OK if no changes are required
A default symbol for your Bandgap Reference circuit will be created.
You can edit the symbol shape if desired by using Create → Shape → Choose.
Execute Create → Cellview → From Cellview to generate the symbol and ensure it matches the schematic. Press OK.
Check the position of the pins, and then press OK to finalize.
5. Create the New Test Cell View:
In the CIW window, execute File → New → Cellview.
Set up the new test cell:
oLibrary: Select the library you created (e.g., Bandgap_Reference_Voltage).
oCell: Name the test cell (e.g., Bandgap_Reference_Test).
oView: Select Schematic.
oPress OK
In the test schematic, connect the necessary input and output pins and components, including the test bench for the reference voltage.
Ensure the circuit is connected properly for simulation.
6. Analog Simulation Using Spectre:
In the Test Cell View window, go to Launch → ADEL (Analog Design Environment).
Execute Setup → Simulation/Directory/Host to set the simulation directory and host.
In the Simulation Setup window, choose Spectre as the simulator and click OK.
Execute Analysis → Choose and select the type of analysis (e.g., DC, Transient, or AC).
oSet the specifications for the analysis and press OK.
Execute Outputs → To be Plotted to choose which signals to observe.
oSelect the input wire (e.g., Vin) and output wire (e.g., Vref) for the reference voltage.
Execute Simulation → Netlist and Run to generate the simulation netlist and start the simulation.
7. Transient Analysis Settings (if applicable):
If performing Transient Analysis, configure the stop time and time step for the simulation.
Observe the stability of the reference voltage (Vref) across time, ensuring minimal fluctuation under varying condition

Results:
The design and implementation of the Bandgap Reference Voltage circuit using Cadence EDA tools were successfully completed.
The simulation results verified that the circuit provided a stable reference voltage (Vref), confirming the correct operation of the Bandgap reference circuit across different temperature and supply voltage variations. The reference voltage output remained stable and close to the expected value (typically 1.2V).
